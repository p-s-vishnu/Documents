## 7 Habits of success

1) **Take ownership** of your life, *you are the CEO of your life*

2) **Accept failure**, stay humble, dont think you are blessed. So even if you fail having that mentality will help you get off the dirt.

3) **What you do at 8 pm determines your future**, in short what you do after your work hours greatly affects your success.

4) **Success is often a lonely road**

5) **The last 10% is the hardest**, complete what you start

6) **Internal motivation**, be internally motivated, try to find the **WHY**

7) **Continuous learning**, your schooling alone can't provide you with everything. You have to seek knowledge yourself.
