## Linear classification
+ The goal of any classification algorithm is to find the class a data point is most likely to belong to.

**Indicator Matrix**
1. The classification in indicator matrix is done by calculating the maximum probability of a data point for each class.
2. [Qualitative data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKEkb_wO1OA) 
3. [One hot encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_4KWmkwmsU), is a method in which categories are encoded into vectors of 0 and 1. 
The name one hot implies, only the corresponsing class will have a '1' and rest all will be zero. A set of these vectors is represented using a matrix.
