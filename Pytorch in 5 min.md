## Pytorch in 5 minutes

### Key features of Pytorch are -

1. Imperative programming 
2. Dynamic graph computation (Design by run)

## Description
* In symbolic programming language, defining computation graph and compiling it are totally different tasks
* Symbolic languages are memory efficient, since you can safely reuse the values for inplace computation.
* But Imperative programmes are more flexible
* Static graphs works well with NN which are fixed size and for CNN.
* Whereas dynamic graphs are best suited for RNN where the size of the NN is dynamic.
* Tensorflow is an example of Symbolic language. It has well documented code so it is beginners friendly and it can be used 
for production level as it is built with distributed computing in mind.
* Pytorch is an example of an imperative language. It is best suited for researchers.
